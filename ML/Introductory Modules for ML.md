**Modules we will import initially to start off our code**
->`pandas` for data handling
->`numpy` for numerical calculations
->`seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization
->`sklearn` for implementing the linear regression model.

```
import pandas as pd   # For data handling
import numpy as np    # For numerical operations
import seaborn as sns # For visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # For plotting
```

Pandas and NumPy are two of the most important libraries in the Python data science ecosystem.

**NumPy:**

- **Purpose:** NumPy provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and high-performance mathematical operations on these arrays.
- **Core Data Structure:** The `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) is the fundamental object in NumPy.
- **Key Features:**
    - Efficient array operations (vectorized operations)
    - Mathematical functions (trigonometry, linear algebra, etc.)
    - Random number generation
    - Broadcasting (performing operations on arrays with different shapes)

**Pandas:**

- **Purpose:**
    
    Pandas builds on top of NumPy to provide easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
    
- **Core Data Structures:**
    
    The `Series` (1-dimensional labeled array) and `DataFrame` (2-dimensional labeled table) are the primary data structures in Pandas.
    
- **Key Features:**
    
    - Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, reshaping)
    - Handling missing data
    - Time series analysis
    - Input/output operations (reading and writing data from various file formats)

**Matplotlib:**

- **Foundation:**
    
    Matplotlib is a low-level plotting library, providing a foundation for creating a wide range of visualizations.
    
- **Flexibility:**
    
    It offers extensive customization options, allowing you to control every aspect of your plots, from axes and labels to colors and markers.
    
- **Complexity:**
    
    Due to its flexibility, Matplotlib can be more verbose, requiring more code to create complex visualizations.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    Ideal for creating highly customized plots, scientific visualizations, and when you need precise control over the plot's appearance.
    

**Seaborn:**

- **Built on Matplotlib:**
    
    Seaborn is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a simpler interface for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
    
- **Ease of Use:**
    
    Seaborn offers a concise syntax and built-in themes, making it easier to create attractive plots with less code.
    
- **Statistical Visualizations:**
    
    Seaborn excels at creating visualizations for statistical analysis, such as:
    
    - Distribution plots (histograms, KDE plots)
    - Scatter plots with regression lines
    - Categorical plots (bar plots, box plots, violin plots)
    - Heatmaps and cluster maps
